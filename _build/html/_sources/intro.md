# Philstats

This is an overview of philosophy of statistics, originally written for [Phlios 133C in Spring 2024](https://bruinlearn.ucla.edu/courses/186475).

The main goal is to set out and evaluate the philosophical ideas of founding figures of Neyman-Pearson, Fisher, Savage, and Jeffreys, and their modern proponents in philosophy and statistics like Mayo and Howson-Urbach and Royall.

But we begin with an overview and review of relevant bits of probability and statistics and interpretations of probability. And we close by discussing various topics such as causality and simplicity and factor analysis.

We are going to use the historical development to orientate the discussion. 

This course does not presuppose any prior familiarity with statistics. 

In terms of prior knowledge, this is structured so that its topic is to statistics roughly what medical ethics is to medicine

Everyone should be able to get a lot out of it, due in part to the ubiquity of statistics in our everyday lives.
