    "In this chapter we look at one view about casuality through a statistical lens. This view is called the *potential outcomes view* and is due primarily to Rubin and his coauthors (culminating in {cite}`Imbens2015-ug`). This is a dominant approach in statistics but is little discussed by philosophers, despite its being framed in terms of counterfactuals, about which philosophers have written extensively. The best introductions to the literature in statistics are, in my view, Holland {cite}`Holland1986-hf` and `Morgan-Winship {cite}`Morgan2014-dh`."

Another way of putting this point is: the Lewis-Stalnaker view is highly sensitive details about the world of evaluation which may not be thematized explicitly in the antecedent and consequent of the conditional.\n",
