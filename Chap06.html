<p>Suppose we have independent random variables <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span> all distributed with respect to one and the same probability distribution <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span>.</p>
<p>That is, we have independent <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\sim F\)</span>.</p>
<p>We view <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span> as the data and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F\)</span> as the cdf of the probability distribution.</p>
<p>Our task is to use the data to learn about the probability distribution.</p>
<p>Being humble creatures, we just start looking at different operations to apply to the data.</p>

<h3>Definition (statistics)<a class="headerlink" href="#definition-statistics" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A <em>statistic</em> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_n\)</span> is just any operation applied to the data <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span>. Here are the some examples many of which you have probably seen before:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Average <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{X}_n\)</span>: at world <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> it is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{X}_n(\omega) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i(\omega)\)</span> (n.b.: average also called mean)</p></li>
<li><p>Median of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1,\ldots, X_n\)</span>: at world <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>, sort the numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_n(\omega)\)</span> in increasing order and find the one in the middle (and in the case where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is odd, take the average of the two middle ones)</p></li>
<li><p>Midspread of <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1, \ldots, X_n\)</span>: at world <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>, sort the numbers <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_n(\omega)\)</span> in increasing order, and split it into four even parts and report the difference between the part at 75% and the part at 25%</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is one that is not very interesting but is indeed ‘an operation applied to the data’:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Square of average: <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{X}_n^2\)</span>: at world <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> it is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\overline{X}^2_n(\omega) = (\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i(\omega))^2\)</span></p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Two perspectives which both statisticians and philosophers at home with<a class="headerlink" href="#two-perspectives-which-both-statisticians-and-philosophers-at-home-with" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>We recognize two different perspectives which are useful:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We can focus on the actual world, that is at a particular world <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> which we happen to inhabit, and we can look at the behavior of the statistic at that world.</p></li>
<li><p>We can focus on what happens across the worlds, and we can view the statistics as random variables and ask questions about e.g. their expectation and their variance.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Further, part and parcel of the tradition in parts of boths disciplines is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>go ceaselessly back and forth between the two perspectives, to the great annoyance of everyone else</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Perspective one: the actual world<a class="headerlink" href="#perspective-one-the-actual-world" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Fix <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> as the actual world. Then all of our statistics deliver real numbers as values when we evaluate them at <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span>. In terms of our actual human activity, these are just the measurements we make.</p>

<p>Philosophers are familiar with this conception of possibility:</p>

<p>The idea of the bootstrap is to generate lots of worlds from the actual world in this way.</p>
<p>Intuitively, the procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> be the actual world, and look at the length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span>-data set <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_n(\omega)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Many other worlds will look just like the actual world, but with the order of observations rearranged, or with one observation made more than once.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulate the observations made at other worlds in this way and calculate the statistic at them.</p></li>
<li><p>When you plot these, the variance (the way in which it is lax or tight around its mean), is a good proxy for the variance of the statistic, if the actual world is like most worlds and if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is sufficiently big.</p></li>

<h3>More formal version of Bootstrap procedure<a class="headerlink" href="#more-formal-version-of-bootstrap-procedure" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>More formally, the procedure is as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Let <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> be the actual world, and look at the histogram of data <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_n(\omega)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose length a length <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> sequence <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1^{\ast}(\omega), \ldots, X_n^{\ast}(\omega)\)</span> from the original data <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X_1(\omega), \ldots, X_n(\omega)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_n^{\ast}:=T_n(X_1^{\ast}(\omega), \ldots, X_n^{\ast}(\omega))\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat steps 2-3 lots and lots of times, say <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span>-many times, until you get <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{n,1}^{\ast}, \ldots, T_{n,B}^{\ast}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compute the value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\frac{1}{B} \sum_{i=1}^B (T_{n,i}^{\ast} - \frac{1}{B}\sum_{i=1}^B T_{n,i}^{\ast})^2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Argue that if <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\omega\)</span> is like most worlds and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is sufficiently big, then this value is close to the variance of the statistic.</p></li>

<h3>Features of the bootstrap<a class="headerlink" href="#features-of-the-bootstrap" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>As you make the number of replications <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(B\)</span> bigger and bigger, you never fix the mean. Hence, the bootstrap all by itself is not good at that (<span id="id5">[<a class="reference internal" href="references.html#id3" title="Laura M Chihara and Tim C Hesterberg.

<li><p>But as you increase the number of replications, you get a better approximation to the variance of the statistic (provided that <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(n\)</span> is big enough too)</p></li>
